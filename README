To build anything, you need to fetch the vcglib submodule with git submodule init && git submodule update

Compiling stltools

To build stltools create a folder outside this one called stltools-build or the like, go into it and run 
"ccmake /path/to/meshcleaner/stltools" to generate Makefiles and then just build using make
You can also open CMakeLists.txt for either project in Qt Creator if you want a IDE

The main meshcleaner project is currently just a proof-of-concept prototype, it's functionality 
will be moved to stltools eventually when it's working properly.
